Here's a more polished and clear version of your README setup instructions:

---

# **Your Project Name**

A simple Node.js + Express application with EJS templating and PostgreSQL/MongoDB integration.

---

## **Features**

- User authentication (register, login, logout)
- Product browsing (anonymous users)
- Shopping cart and order management (logged-in users)
- Admin panel for managing products, users, and orders

---

## **Getting Started**

Follow these instructions to set up and run the application on your local machine.

### **Prerequisites**

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or later)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) or [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

---

### **1. Clone the Repository**

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
```

---

### **2. Install Dependencies**

Install the required Node.js packages:

```bash
npm install
```

---

### **3. Set Up Environment Variables**

1. Create a `.env` file in the project root directory.
2. Use the provided `.env.example` file as a reference:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
3. Open the `.env` file and fill in the required environment variables:
   ```dotenv
   PORT=3000
   COOKIE_SECRET=your_cookie_secret
   DATABASE_URL=postgres://username:password@localhost:5432/yourdatabase
   ```
   - Replace `your_cookie_secret` with a random secure string (e.g., from [randomkeygen.com](https://randomkeygen.com/)).
   - Replace `DATABASE_URL` with your PostgreSQL connection string.

---

### **4. Set Up the Database**

If you're using PostgreSQL, run the provided SQL script to create the required tables:

```bash
node setup.js
```

Alternatively, you can manually execute the `init.sql` file in your database tool of choice.

---

### **5. Start the Application**

Run the app using:

```bash
node app.js
```

The server should now be running at:

```
http://localhost:3000
```
